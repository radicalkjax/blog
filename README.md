My personal corner of the internet. A place to share my thoughts, projects, and journey.

## hey, I'm Kali <3

weeb | nerd | goober | hack-a-doodler | smartest airhead

I'm a Technical Solutions Architect, AI SecOps Researcher, and full-stack dev who fell into hacking through game modding and my love for music. These days I focus on reverse engineering, open-source tooling, and building things that help people.

This site is where I document my journey - the technical stuff, the personal stuff, and everything in between.

## what's here

**Blog** - thoughts on security, AI, malware analysis, and life as a trans girl.

**Projects** - things I'm building:
- Various security tools and experiments
- Rocket Pup (game concept)
- Caliphoria (post-apocalyptic California travel game)
- malwarEvangelist (community platform)

**Art** - photos and other creative stuff

**About Me** - the professional resume bits and the personal journey

**My Trans Journey** - because visibility matters

## tech stuff

Built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. Uses the DM Mono font because monospace is life. The purple aesthetic (#6d105a) is very much intentional.

## philosophy

> Hacker joy isn't just about breaking things. It's about building communities that celebrate curiosity, learning, and authentic connection in our world.

I believe in opening doors and carving paths for others. Tech should be accessible, communities should be inclusive, and we should all be lifting each other up.
