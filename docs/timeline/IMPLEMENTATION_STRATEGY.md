# Timeline Implementation Strategy - SIMPLIFIED APPROACH

**Project:** Interactive Life Journey Timeline
**Focus:** File-based, easy to maintain, data-driven
**Timeline Structure:** Personal Journey → Transition Journey → [Coming Out, Bottom Surgery, FFS]

---

## ⚠️ UPDATED APPROACH - Simplified & Maintainable

### Problem with Original JSON Approach

❌ Large monolithic JSON file
❌ Hardcoded nested structures
❌ Difficult to add new markers
❌ Manual blog post linking
❌ Not leveraging Jekyll's power

### New File-Based Approach

✅ Individual marker files (easy to add/edit)
✅ Folder structure = timeline hierarchy
✅ Automatic blog post discovery via tags
✅ Markdown content support
✅ Version control friendly

## File Structure

```
_timeline/                          # Jekyll collection
├── personal-journey/               # Main timeline folder
│   ├── transition-journey.md       # Breakout marker
│   ├── career-milestone.md         # Regular marker
│   └── demo-event.md              # Regular marker
│
├── transition/                     # Breakout timeline folder
│   ├── coming-out.md              # Sub-timeline marker
│   ├── bottom-surgery.md          # Sub-timeline marker
│   └── ffs.md                     # Sub-timeline marker
│
├── coming-out/                     # Sub-timeline folder
│   ├── accepting-myself.md

└── ffs/                           # Sub-timeline folder
    └── research-phase.md
```

## Marker File Format

Each marker is a simple `.md` file with YAML front matter:

**Example: `_timeline/personal-journey/transition-journey.md`**

```yaml
---
id: transition-journey
date: 2021-08-01
title: "Transition Journey Begins"
description: "My journey as a transgender woman - exploring identity, growth, and authenticity."
icon: transgender
color: "#f84ef8"
timeline: personal-journey        # Parent timeline ID
has_breakout: true
breakout_timeline: transition     # Points to _timeline/transition/ folder
links:
  - title: "About My Journey"
    url: "/about/trans-journey.html"
    type: internal
tags:
  - transgender
  - personal
  - milestone
---

Optional markdown content here. You can write as much or as little as you want.
This content will be displayed in the content card when someone clicks the marker.

You can use **markdown formatting**, lists, links, etc.
```

**Example: `_timeline/bottom-surgery/decision.md`**

```yaml
---
id: bottom-surgery-decision
date: 2024-10-30
title: "Made the Decision"
description: "Decided to pursue gender confirmation surgery. Navigating the hurdles, preparation, and joy of this decision."
icon: check-circle
color: "#f84ef8"
timeline: bottom-surgery           # Parent timeline
tags:
  - transgender
  - bottom-surgery
  - milestone
links:
  - title: "Read: Bottom Surgery - Hurdles, Prep, and Joy"
    url: "/2024/10/30/bottom-surgery-hurdles-prep-and-joy.html"
    type: blog
---

This was a pivotal moment in my journey...
```

---

## Blog Post Integration

**In your blog posts, just add a timeline tag:**

```yaml
---
title: "Bottom Surgery: Hurdles, Prep, and Joy"
date: 2024-10-30
tags:
  - transgender
  - bottom-surgery        # Matches marker tags
  - personal
timeline_marker: bottom-surgery-decision  # Optional: direct link to marker
---
```

Jekyll will automatically:
1. Find all posts with matching tags
2. Display them in the marker's content card
3. No manual linking required!

---

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Configure Jekyll Collection

**In `_config.yml`:**

```yaml
collections:
  timeline:
    output: false
    permalink: /timeline/:path/
```

### Step 2: Create Folder Structure

```bash
mkdir -p _timeline/personal-journey
mkdir -p _timeline/transition
mkdir -p _timeline/coming-out
mkdir -p _timeline/bottom-surgery
mkdir -p _timeline/ffs
```

### Step 3: Create Marker Files

Create individual `.md` files for each marker (examples below).

### Step 4: Update Timeline Page

Modify `pages/personal-journey.html` to build JSON from Jekyll collection data.

### Step 5: Update JavaScript

Minimal changes - still reads JSON, but now it's generated by Jekyll from files.

---

## Example Marker Files to Create

### 1. Main Timeline Markers

**`_timeline/personal-journey/transition-journey.md`:**
```yaml
---
id: transition-journey
date: 2021-08-01
title: "Transition Journey Begins"
description: "My journey as a transgender woman"
icon: transgender
color: "#f84ef8"
timeline: personal-journey
has_breakout: true
breakout_timeline: transition
---
```

**`_timeline/personal-journey/demo-event.md`:**
```yaml
---
id: demo-event
date: 2023-01-15
title: "Demo Milestone"
description: "Example marker for testing"
icon: star
color: "#f84ef8"
timeline: personal-journey
---
```

### 2. Transition Timeline Markers

**`_timeline/transition/coming-out.md`:**
```yaml
---

date: 2021-08-01
title: "Coming Out Journey"
description: "The process of coming out as transgender"

title: "FFS Journey"
description: "Facial feminization surgery journey (placeholder)"
icon: smile
color: "#ff6bff"
timeline: transition
has_breakout: true
breakout_timeline: ffs
---
```

### 3. Bottom Surgery Sub-Timeline

**`_timeline/bottom-surgery/decision.md`:**
```yaml
---
id: bottom-surgery-decision
date: 2024-10-30
title: "Made the Decision"
description: "Decided to pursue gender confirmation surgery"
icon: check-circle
timeline: bottom-surgery
tags:
  - transgender
  - bottom-surgery
links:
  - title: "Read: Bottom Surgery - Hurdles, Prep, and Joy"
    url: "/2024/10/30/bottom-surgery-hurdles-prep-and-joy.html"
    type: blog
---
```

**`_timeline/bottom-surgery/trust-physician.md`:**
```yaml
---
id: bottom-surgery-trust
date: 2024-12-24
title: "Trust the Physician"
description: "Learning to trust the medical process"
icon: user-md
timeline: bottom-surgery
tags:
  - transgender
  - bottom-surgery
links:
  - title: "Read: Trust the Physician"
    url: "/2024/12/24/trust-the-physician.html"
    type: blog
---
```

### 4. Coming Out Sub-Timeline

**`_timeline/coming-out/accepting-myself.md`:**
```yaml
---
id: coming-out-self
date: 2021-06-15
title: "Accepting Myself"
description: "Coming to terms with my identity"
icon: heart
timeline: coming-out
---
```

**`_timeline/coming-out/told-family.md`:**
```yaml
---
id: coming-out-family
date: 2021-08-01
title: "Told My Family"
description: "Coming out to my family"
icon: users
timeline: coming-out
---
```

---

## Benefits

### Easy to Add Content

**Want to add a new marker?** Just create a new file:

```bash
# Add "Started HRT" to transition timeline
nano _timeline/transition/started-hrt.md
```

```yaml
---
id: started-hrt
date: 2021-08-15
title: "Started HRT"
description: "Beginning hormone replacement therapy"
icon: prescription-bottle
timeline: transition
tags:
  - transgender
  - hrt
  - medical
---

Today I started hormone replacement therapy...
```

**That's it!** Jekyll automatically includes it.

### Easy to Add a New Timeline

**Want to add "Career Journey"?**

1. Create marker: `_timeline/personal-journey/career.md`
2. Create folder: `mkdir _timeline/career`
3. Add markers: `_timeline/career/first-job.md`, etc.

### Easy to Link Blog Posts

**Just match tags:**

```yaml
# In blog post
tags:
  - transgender
  - bottom-surgery
```

Automatically appears in all markers with matching tags!

## Migration from JSON

### Old Way (timeline.json):
```json
{
  "timeline": {
    "markers": [
      {
        "id": "marker-1",
        "title": "Event",
        "date": "2021-01-01",
        "hasBreakout": true,
        "breakoutTimeline": {
          "markers": [...]  // Nested forever
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### New Way:
```
_timeline/personal-journey/event.md  (5 lines)
_timeline/event/sub-event-1.md       (5 lines)
_timeline/event/sub-event-2.md       (5 lines)
```

## Development Checklist

### Phase 1: Setup Collection
- [ ] Add collection to `_config.yml`
- [ ] Create `_timeline/` folder structure
- [ ] Create initial marker files

### Phase 2: Update Timeline Page
- [ ] Modify `personal-journey.html` to use Jekyll data
- [ ] Add Liquid template to build JSON from collection
- [ ] Test rendering

### Phase 3: Update JavaScript (minimal changes)
- [ ] Update data URL to use Jekyll-generated JSON
- [ ] Test all interactions still work

### Phase 4: Blog Integration
- [ ] Add tags to existing blog posts
- [ ] Implement tag matching logic
- [ ] Display related posts in content cards

### Phase 5: Polish
- [ ] Add markdown content to markers
- [ ] Test adding new markers
- [ ] Documentation

---

## Next Steps

1. **Configure collection in `_config.yml`**
2. **Create folder structure**
3. **Create marker files** (start with 5-10 markers)
4. **Update timeline page** to use Jekyll data
5. **Test and iterate**

This approach is **much more maintainable** and follows Jekyll best practices!
