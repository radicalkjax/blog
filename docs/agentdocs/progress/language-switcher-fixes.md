# Language Switcher UI Fixes

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Dropdown Behavior
- Changed from hover-based to click-based interaction
- Replaced `<div>` with `<button>` element for better accessibility
- Added proper event handling to keep menu open when clicked
- Menu now closes when:
  - Clicking outside the component
  - Selecting a language
  - Pressing ESC key (accessibility)

### 2. Repositioned & Resized Component
- Moved language switcher underneath social media icons
- Reduced button size:
  - Padding: 4px 8px (from 8px 12px)
  - Font size: 11px (from 14px)
  - Border: 1px (from 2px)
- Changed display to show language code (EN, ES, FR, JA) instead of full name
- Made dropdown menu appear above the button (bottom: 100%)

### 3. Improved Visual Design
- Smaller, more compact button design
- Simplified to show globe icon + language code
- Reduced dropdown menu width to 120px
- Smaller font sizes throughout (11px for menu items)
- Maintained visual consistency with site theme

## Technical Implementation

### HTML Structure
```html
<button class="language-switcher-toggle" aria-label="Language selection" aria-expanded="false">
  <i class="fas fa-globe"></i>
  <span class="language-code">EN</span>
</button>
```

### JavaScript Fix
- Uses `classList.toggle('show')` for explicit menu control
- Proper event propagation handling with `stopPropagation()`
- ARIA attributes update for accessibility
- Click event instead of hover for mobile compatibility

### CSS Updates
- `.language-switcher-menu.show` class for visibility control
- Positioned menu above button for better UX
- Smaller dimensions throughout
- Maintained theme colors and transitions

## Result
✅ Dropdown stays open when clicked
✅ Smaller, more subtle button design
✅ Positioned below social icons as requested
✅ Mobile-friendly click interaction
✅ Accessible with ARIA attributes
